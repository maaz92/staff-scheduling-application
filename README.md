#  TypeORM / Express / TypeScript RESTful API

Based on a boilerplate with focus on best practices and painless developer experience:

- Spin it up with single command 🌀
- TypeScript first
- RESTful APIs
- JWT authentication with role based authorization

## TODO
- Add comprehensive tests
- Decouple View layer from Entity layer and user adapters to map them
- Add more validations
- Add Pagination

## Requirements

- [Node v16+](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Running

_Easily set up a local development environment with single command!_

- clone the repo
- `npm run docker:dev` 🚀

Visit [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/) or if using Postman grab [config](/postman).

### _What happened_ 💥

Containers created:

- Postgres database container seeded with 💊 Breaking Bad characters in `Users` table (default credentials `user=walter`, `password=white` in [.env file](./.env))
- Node (v16 Alpine) container with running boilerplate RESTful API service
- and one Node container instance to run tests locally or in CI

## Features:

- [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) framework
- [TypeScript v4](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) codebase
- [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) using Data Mapper pattern
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) environment:
  - Easily start local development using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) with single command `npm run docker:dev`
  - Connect to different staging or production environments `npm run docker:[stage|prod]`
  - Ready for **microservices** development and deployment.  
    Once API changes are made, just build and push new docker image with your favourite CI/CD tool  
    `docker build -t <username>/api-boilerplate:latest .`  
    `docker push <username>/api-boilerplate:latest`
  - Run unit, integration (or setup with your frontend E2E) tests as `docker exec -ti be_boilerplate_test sh` and `npm run test`
- Contract first REST API design:
  - never break API again with HTTP responses and requests payloads using [type definitions](./src/types/express/index.d.ts)
  - Consistent schema error [response](./src/utils/response/custom-error/types.ts). Your frontend will always know how to handle errors thrown in `try...catch` statements 💪
- JWT authentication and role based authorization using custom middleware
- Set local, stage or production [environmental variables](./config) with [type definitions](./src/types/ProcessEnv.d.ts)
- Logging with [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan)
- Unit and integration tests with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/)
- Linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) code formatter
- Git hooks with [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)
- Automated npm & Docker dependency updates with [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) (set to patch version only)
- Commit messages must meet [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.
